## Requirements Definition

### Functional Requirements
**Data Retrieval** 
* The user has to be able to see a text box that the user will need to enter a pokemon name. The user will also need to see the link of the sound file of the pokemon. \

**User Interface**
* The user has to type in pokemon names that they are interested in. If there is enough time, there mich be a GUI with buttons instead of typing to lower user error. \

**Data Display**
* After the user inputs the name of a pokemon, it will, without warning,  play the pokemons cry. If the pokemon does not exist or the user inputs a error, it will play 10 random pokemon's cry at the same time.


### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
* The system should perform decently well with little to no delays in the system. The system should not freeze or crash unless the user is messing around.

**Reliablilty**
* The data is really reliable as the API is used
